Project Title: Travel Bucket List Tracker

Project Overview:
This project is designed to make travel planning more exciting and organized! The idea is to create a platform where users can log in and maintain a personalized bucket list of destinations they dream of visiting. Users can add, edit, categorize, and track their progress as they explore new places.

The purpose of this project isn’t just to showcase technical skills but also to build something practical and engaging. By working on this, I’ll demonstrate my understanding of course concepts while creating a useful tool for travel enthusiasts.

Key Features:
User login to access and manage their personal travel bucket list.
APIs for handling travel data (add, view, edit, delete destinations).
A database to store user accounts and their respective travel lists.
A React-based frontend for an interactive and user-friendly experience.
Secure authentication to protect user data and ensure privacy.
Deployment of both frontend and backend to live environments.
Bonus features (if time permits), such as travel inspiration suggestions or integration with Google Maps.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React (with Vite for setup)
Backend: Node.js + Express.js
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
Deployment: Vercel for the frontend and Render for the backend
API Testing: Postman or Bruno
Why This Project:
I’ve always loved the idea of traveling and discovering new places, so why not create a tool that helps people plan their adventures? Whether it’s adding dream destinations like “Santorini, Greece” or “Kyoto, Japan,” this project combines both fun and functionality. While it seems simple, it challenges me to apply what I’ve learned—database management, API building, frontend development, and deployment. Plus, it’s exciting to think I’m building something that could help people stay motivated to achieve their travel goals!
